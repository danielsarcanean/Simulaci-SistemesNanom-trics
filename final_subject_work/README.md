# Nanoparticle self-assembly & conjugation modeller

**Summary**

This code aims to produce a Cerium metallic nanoparticle .pdb, by introducing a Montecarlo 'Metropolis-Hastings' algorithm & considering a simplified crystallization round-up stacking. Later on, the self-assembly properties of the generated structures are tested within a ... (to be reviewed)
